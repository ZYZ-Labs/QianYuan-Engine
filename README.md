# QianYuan-Engine

A prototype implementation for the QianYuan Engine project. This repository
contains a minimal skeleton based on the documentation located in `docs/`.
It provides:

- A simple coordinator service built with FastAPI.
- Placeholder modules for a protocol gateway and edge client.
- Basic unit tests demonstrating task dispatch and status query.

Run the coordinator locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
